title: Why I Shy Away from Statistical Tools

After six years of studying statistics, I have developed a tendency to shy away from using the statistical tools I learned in school. The reason for this is as follows:

Let's consider an example. Yesterday, I saw a guy sharing a project in a school forum about CSGO items trading, which is some sort of a minimal version of quantum trading. If I want to do something similar, how can my statistical background help me? Time series analysis, for instance? I did learn some models from this class, but I feel that the whole idea of modeling time series using formulas and predicting future values misses the big picture of what is happening in the market. I believe that the formalized probability math language, such as distributions, is helpful in formalizing uncertainty. However, the tools that statisticians have developed (or the way they are taught) can be misleading. When we develop methods based on wrong assumptions, we should focus more on the results and how these methods capture certain phenomena in different fields, instead of developing additional methods to validate these assumptions. This might be why statistics has failed as a discipline.

I believe that the only way to understand what is happening in reality is to work with data directly and develop a personal understanding of patterns and trends. Unfortunately, this is not the focus of the statistics classes I have taken.
